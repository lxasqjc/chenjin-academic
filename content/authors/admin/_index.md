Hi! I’m a research assistant in the [Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) at [UCL’s AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), working with [Dr Thomy Mertzanidou](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/T.Mertzanidou/), [Prof. Daniel Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) and collebrate closely with [Dr Ryutaro Tanno](https://rt416.github.io/) from [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

My recent research focuses on multimodal-multiscale-multitask self-supervised representation learning, image generation and mapping. I have also developed attention-based learnable sampling methods for either [data efficient](https://lxasqjc.github.io/learn-downsample.github.io/) or [computation efficient](https://github.com/lxasqjc/Foveation-Segmentation) machine learning, and applied on segmentation of large volume high resolution images.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Computational Geoscience at the [Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/energy-geoscience-infrastructure-society/research/ige.htm/), [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/). My thesis was about [Developing a Hierarchical Digital Rock Analysis Workflow](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/199293389.pdf), involving machine learning-based multi scale-modal image fusion, reconstruction and fluid simulation.

**News**:
- Jan 2022: Our work on [Learning to downsample](https://lxasqjc.github.io/learn-downsample.github.io/) is accepted by [ICLR 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HndgQudNb91), which aiming to adapt the computation/sampling budget to the difficulty of segmented pixel/region.
- July 2021: We are organizing the [foveation project](https://medicss.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects-2021/#foveation) on [MedICSS Summer School 2021](https://medicss.cs.ucl.ac.uk/programme-2021/).
- Sep 2020: a shorter version of our work on [Foveation for Segmentation](https://chenjin.netlify.app/publication/foveation/) is accepted at MICCAI 2020, also check out [full extensive version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15124v2).
- Aug 2020: Our attempts on [Disentangling human annotation error](https://chenjin.netlify.app/publication/humanerror/) is accepted at NeurIPS 2020.

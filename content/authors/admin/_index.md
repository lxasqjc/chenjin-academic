Hi! My name is Chen Jin, and I’m a research scientist at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at [Data Science & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.astrazeneca.com/r-d/data-science-and-ai.html), AstraZeneca (UK). My research focuses on [Large Multimodal Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12274), Vision-Language Human-Machine Interactions, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing for Healthcare, and Predictive Models.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) at [UCL’s AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), where I worked on Multimodal-Multiscale-Multitask representation learning, image generation and mapping. I have also developed attention-based learnable sampling methods for either [data efficient](https://lxasqjc.github.io/learn-downsample.github.io/) or [computation efficient](https://github.com/lxasqjc/Foveation-Segmentation) machine learning, and applied on segmentation of large volume high-resolution images.

Externally, I got the privilege to collaborate closely with [Dr Ryutaro Tanno](https://rt416.github.io/) from Google DeepMind, [Prof. Daniel Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) from CMIC UCL and [Prof Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/) from Artificial Intelligence and Medicine at the University of Cambridge.

I obtained my PhD in Computational Geoscience at the [Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/energy-geoscience-infrastructure-society/research/ige.htm/), [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/). My thesis was about developing a Hierarchical Digital Rock Analysis Workflow, involving machine learning-based multi scale-modal image fusion, reconstruction and fluid simulation.

**News**:
- Jan 2022: Our work on [Learning to downsample](https://lxasqjc.github.io/learn-downsample.github.io/) is accepted by [ICLR 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HndgQudNb91), which aiming to adapt the computation/sampling budget to the difficulty of segmented pixel/region.
- July 2021: We are organizing the [foveation project](https://medicss.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects-2021/#foveation) on [MedICSS Summer School 2021](https://medicss.cs.ucl.ac.uk/programme-2021/).
- Sep 2020: a shorter version of our work on [Foveation for Segmentation](https://chenjin.netlify.app/publication/foveation/) is accepted at MICCAI 2020, also check out [full extensive version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15124v2).
- Aug 2020: Our attempts on [Disentangling human annotation error](https://chenjin.netlify.app/publication/humanerror/) is accepted at NeurIPS 2020.

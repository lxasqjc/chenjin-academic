Hi! I’m a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with [Dr Thomy Mertzanidou](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/T.Mertzanidou/), [Prof. Daniel Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) and [Dr Marnix Jansen](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJJAN31).

My recent research interests include efficient deep learning based analysis of large volume images like [ultra-high resolution 2D images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15124), 3D image or video streams in healthcare applications. I’m also interested in the multiple scale/ modality learning and 3D reconstruction, particularly in medical or geographical image domain.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in the [Institute of GeoEnergy Engineering](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/energy-geoscience-infrastructure-society/research/ige.htm/), [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/). My thesis was about [Developing a Hierarchical Digital Rock Analysis Workflow](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/199293389.pdf), involving machine learning based multi-scale 2D/3D image reconstruction, segmentation, registration, fusion and fluid flow simulation.

During PhD, I also worked as a research intern at [Canadian Natural Resources International (UK)](https://www.cnrl.com/) in Aberdeen. I was responsible for building the physical reservoir scale models and investigated fluid flow behaviours through simulation, and with the fortune to present the team and helped decisions worth millions.
